## Introduction ##

We live in a digital era where information is vast and at its peak. The downside to this is information overload - we quickly forget, skip or miss out on information, content, and ideas that are useful to us.

In the spirit of productivity, we need a way to seamlessly capture the ideas that stand out in the moment and store them, one such tool that aids this is Glasp.

## What is Glasp ##

GLASP stands for “Greatest Legacy Accumulated as Shared Proof”. Glasp is a social web highlighter that people can use to highlight and organize quotes and ideas from the web without switching back and forth between screens and accessing other like-minded people’s learning at the same time.

Kazuki Nakayashiki, a co-founder of Glasp, was inspired to undergo this project after a near-death experience at the age of 20. This incident led him to experience a deep sense of fear and loss as he confronted the reality that his existence may suddenly disappear from this world. This sparked a determination to leave behind a legacy that would show his contribution to humanity.

Glasp's mission is to democratize access to other people’s learning and experiences that they have collected throughout their lives as a utilitarian legacy.

## Why Use Glasp ##

1. Save Time and Stay Organized: According to a new study from Microsoft Corp., people now generally lose concentration after eight seconds while that of a goldfish is 9! So, in a digitalized lifestyle, how do we seamlessly capture the things that stand out to us at the moment without getting distracted? With Glasp, you can quickly and easily highlight important information on any webpage without having to switch between different apps or screens. This makes it easier to stay organized and track the most important ideas and insights from your research.

2. Community Knowledge Sharing: Because Glasp is a social highlighting tool, it's used to connect with people who are interested in the same topics as you. By following other users and exploring the content they've highlighted, you can discover new ideas and perspectives you might not have encountered otherwise.

3. Collaboration: Glasp is a powerful collaboration tool that can help you and your team to work more efficiently and effectively. By sharing your highlights with your colleagues and collaborators, you can ensure everyone is on the same page and has access to the most important information and insights.
